\usage{
TCRgrapherCounts(
  TCRgrObject,
  v_gene = TRUE,
  j_gene = FALSE,
  cluster_id = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{TCRgrObject}{TCRgrapher object. It can be constructed by calling the
TCRgrapher( ) function.}

\item{v_gene}{Boolean value. If 'v_gene' is 'TRUE', clonotypes with the same amino
acid sequences but different V genes are presented in different rows.
Default value is 'TRUE'.}

\item{j_gene}{Boolean value. If 'j_gene' is 'TRUE', clonotypes with the same amino
acid sequences but different J genes are presented in different rows.
Default value is 'FALSE'.}

\item{cluster_id}{Boolean value. Default value is 'FALSE'. If 'cluster_id' is 'TRUE',
clonotypes with the same cluster_id will be grouped and will be presented in
one row. In feature_info table feature' column will contain cluster_id and
genes if corresponding parameters are chosen. If 'cluster_id' is already in the
clonotype table it will be taken from there. Otherwise, it will be defined using
'make_TCR_graph' and 'find_TCR_components' functions. See documentation.}
}
\value{
Function returns TCRgrapherCounts object that contains clonoset and
metadata from TCRgrapher object, count table and feature info table
}
\description{
Function takes a TCRgrapher object as an input and creates a count table
where each row corresponds to an unique amino acid sequence and each column
corresponds to the sample.
